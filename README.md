# LogitechMouseGestures
Lua script for basic mouse gestures for Windows.

## How to use:
In your Logitech Gaming Software Panel right click the profile in which you want the script to be running (for instance Standard for your normal desktop environment). Got to "Create Script" and just paste or import the code from GitHub. You can enable the reset window function if you want to use a dedicated button for gestures or just leave it disabled so you can use a button that is in use. I recommend using a dedicated mouse button because the software seems to be treating reserved mouse buttons differently.

## Gestures:
Name | Action  | Description | Default
---- | ------- | ----------- | -------
TaskView  | Winkey+Tab | Opens task view (Win10,11) | enabled
Minimise | Winkey+d | Minimises all windows | enabled
MoveDesktopLeft | WinKey+Ctrl+Left | Moves to desktop at relative left | enabled
MoveDesktopRight | WinKey+Ctrl+Right | Moves to desktop at relative right | enabled
